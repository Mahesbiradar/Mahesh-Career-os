# Career OS — STATUS
Last updated: 2026-07-05 | Week 2 review complete — advancing to Day 7
Current phase: Ignition (Days 1–30)
Active domain: Python — Level 1 Fundamentals
Next lesson: Day 7 — Functions

---

## SYSTEM RULES (agent must read before generating any lesson or evaluation)

Daily flow:
  Morning  → Paste PROMPT 1 → agent generates DAY_N.md lesson file
  After work → Paste PROMPT 2 → paste your submission → agent evaluates and updates STATUS.md
  Sunday   → Paste PROMPT 3 → weekly review + next week plan

Grade system per submission:
  PASS      → concept understood, assignment correct, move to next day
  NEEDS WORK → concept understood but execution has specific gaps — listed by agent
  REDO      → fundamental misunderstanding — same topic next day before advancing

Advancement rule:
  PASS or NEEDS WORK (with understanding confirmed) → advance to next day
  REDO → repeat the same topic next day. New lesson generated for the same concept.

Theory blocks (OS, CN, DBMS):
  Start at Day 10. Built into every lesson file as a 20-min block.
  Not evaluated as code — evaluated as written explanation in submission.

Communication practice:
  Built into every lesson. 15 min. Written output expected with each submission.

## PYTHON PROGRESS — Level Tracker

Python has 5 levels. Track each topic's completion status here.

### Level 1 — Fundamentals

| Topic | Day | Grade | Notes |
|-------|-----|-------|-------|
| Variables & Data Types | 1 | PASS | f-string output, type(), input(), ValueError stretch |
| Operators & Expressions | 2 | NEEDS WORK | f-string labels inconsistent, short-circuit not proved directly, bool() not used in stretch |
| Strings | 3 | PASS | All methods correct, slicing precise, stretch completed; minor label typos (stripped/World vs Stripped/Words) |
| Control Flow | 4 | NEEDS WORK | Falsy check: used double-negation instead of `if name:`, label had extra space |
| Loops | 5 | REDO | `continue` not used at all (if-condition used instead); break print had literal `<>` around item instead of exact value; non-empty list case never created/demonstrated |
| Loops (repeat) | 6 | PASS (resubmit) | Fixed `Odd` casing and stretch spacing after first evaluation; all 5 required items met cleanly |
| Functions | 7 | — | Pending |
| Lists | 7 | — | Pending |
| Tuples + Sets | 8 | — | Pending |
| Dictionaries | 9 | — | Pending |
| Exception Handling | 10 | — | Pending |

### Level 2 — Intermediate (Days ~11–20)
Not started. Covers: OOP, File Handling, Modules, Comprehensions, Generators

### Level 3 — Applied Python (Days ~21–30)
Not started. Covers: Decorators, Context Managers, Standard Library, Type Hints

## SUBMISSION LOG

| Day | File | Topic | Grade | Date | Key Feedback |
|-----|------|-------|-------|------|-------------|
| 1 | submissions/day-01.py | Variables & Data Types | PASS | 2026-06-27 | Clean f-string output, type() correct, input() + int() conversion good |
| 2 | submissions/day-02.py | Operators & Expressions | NEEDS WORK | 2026-06-28 | f-string labels said "x-y" for all ops; short-circuit via if/else not direct proof; stretch used if/else not bool() |
| 3 | submissions/day-03.py | Strings | PASS | 2026-06-29 | All 7 requirements met, stretch completed; minor label typos; doesn't know name "short-circuit evaluation" yet |
| 4 | submissions/day-04.py | Control Flow | NEEDS WORK | 2026-06-30 | Falsy check used double-negation (`if not name != ""`) instead of `if name:`; label had extra space `"Name : "` |
| 5 | submissions/day-05.py | Loops | REDO | 2026-07-04 | `continue` requirement skipped entirely (used `if num % 2 != 0:` instead); `Found: <item>` printed literal angle brackets; only empty-list case demonstrated, non-empty list never created |
| 6 | submissions/day-06.py | Loops (repeat) | NEEDS WORK → PASS | 2026-07-04 | First pass: `odd` lowercase instead of `Odd`. Resubmitted same day with fix + stretch spacing corrected — all requirements met |

## REDO QUEUE

Problems/topics that need to be redone before advancing.
(Empty = clear path forward)

| Day | Topic | Reason | Status |
|-----|-------|--------|--------|
| 5 | Loops | `continue` never used (if-condition substituted); break print had literal `<>` around item; non-empty list case never created/tested | Resolved in Day 6 — all three gaps fixed |

## NOTES FOR NEXT LESSON GENERATOR

- WEEK 2 REVIEW (2026-07-05) COMPLETE. Day 7 starts fresh: Functions, Level 1 Fundamentals.
- Next week's path: Day 7 Functions → Day 8 Lists → Day 9 Tuples+Sets → Day 10 Dictionaries (DBMS theory block begins, 20 min/day) → Day 11 Exception Handling (closes out Level 1) → Day 12 OOP basics (Level 2 begins; OS theory block begins) → Day 13 OOP continued.
- RESOLVED from Day 5: `continue` now used correctly (skip-check + unconditional print, no if-wrapper substitute); both empty and non-empty list truthiness cases created and printed.
- Standing carry-forward watch (Days 2,4,5,6 all had this in some form): exact-output string discipline — mismatched labels, extra spaces, angle brackets, wrong casing. Day 6 needed a resubmit to catch the casing miss. Day 7 should include at least one exact-string requirement and note whether it's caught on the FIRST attempt now, not just on correction — this is the biggest open concept gap heading into next week.
- Communication: STAR labels and "I"-voice are now resolved as of Day 6 (3rd attempt). Spelling errors persist: "taks" (task), "thorough" instead of "through", "actuall" (actual), "which which" (duplicate word), "issue's" (should be "issues"). Day 7 can move past STAR to a new communication task (e.g., a short professional update or a different behavioral prompt) but should keep a proofread-before-submit step to target spelling specifically.
- Theory block starts Day 10 (DBMS), Day 12 (OS), Day 14 (CN) — not yet active.
